## Hi there 😌

I'm Malgorzata, a computer science and math student at The University of Manchester.

I love being creative, designing and building applications I'm passionate about is something I can't live without.
Seeing how random ideas can develop and grow over time is always fun.

My current tech stack is:
<ul>
  <li>🦀 Rust</li>
  <li>🐍 Python</li>
  <li>🩵 Typescript</li>
  <li>💨 Tailwind </li>

</ul>

Asides from that my favourite tools are blender and aseprite.
